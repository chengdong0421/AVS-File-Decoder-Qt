### AVS File Decoder (Qt version)

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/grandchild/AVS-File-Decoder-Qt/master/etc/preview.png)

This is (or will be) the Qt port of the [AVS File Decoder](https://github.com/grandchild/AVS-File-Decoder).
It exists because batch conversion turned out a bit slow over Javascript and HTTP POST requests the way I was doing it in the [multiple](https://github.com/grandchild/AVS-File-Decoder/tree/multiple) branch over there.

Any functional updates will most likely appear in the [JS repo](https://github.com/grandchild/AVS-File-Decoder) and will not be elaborately mirrored in this readme or wiki.
